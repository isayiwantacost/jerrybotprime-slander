    <p style="color: #FFFFFF; margin-top: 3px; font-size: 22px">Bots themselves are not inherently "bad" or "good". It depends on their purpose and how they are used. Bots can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, from automating mundane tasks to providing customer support to monitoring social media for trends and insights.

However, some bots can be considered "bad" if they are used for malicious purposes, such as spreading false information, engaging in spam or phishing activities, or launching cyberattacks. In these cases, bots are used to deceive and harm people.

Additionally, some people may find bots to be annoying or intrusive, especially if they are used for spamming or other unwanted activities. This can lead to a negative perception of bots in general.

It's important to remember that bots are a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad purposes. It's up to the individuals or organizations creating and using the bots to ensure that they are being used ethically and responsibly.</p>
